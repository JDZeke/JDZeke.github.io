        <p>Later in in 2016, I decided that I wanted to create a game, and after some research I found that the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Game Engine</a> would be a good way to start. C# was very similar to C++, which I was already relatively familiar with, so making a game in Unity would be easy.<br><br>I was wrong.<br><br>The knowledge I used to make Breakthrough was the cumulation of what I learned in 10+ previous game attempts. I wanted to make something original and I ended up with a unique twist on a tower defense game.<br><br>During the game, spaces in the 3 x 3 grid will fill up randomly. Each filled space has a number indicating the spaceâ€™s health. Tapping the space will decrease the health by 1, and eventually the space will become empty again once the health has been decreased to 0. If all spaces are filled at once, the game is over. Over time the spaces will fill up more frequently and with more health so turret weapons can be purchased with coins and dragged onto the game board to help keep the squares empty. The weapons are each equipped with unique abilities and as they become unlocked, the game becomes more and more strategic.</p>
