        <p>After a year in a high school C++ class, I managed to put together a working ultimate tic-tac-toe program. To win, a player must first win three normal tic-tac-toe games in a row. The boards are labeled 1-9 and the board a player moves on is determined by the position of the previous playerâ€™s move relative to the board they moved in.<br><br>This program was the first of mine that used classes and objects.</p>
