        <p>My first introduction to computer science came in high school where I was lucky enough to take an Intro to Visual Basic class. Visual Basic served as a great first language due to the ease of creating simple stand-alone applications.<br><br>My final project was a application that lets up to five people play the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps">craps dice game</a>. Each player enters a name and the application will do everything else.<br><br>Although this application takes the suspense out of the original craps dice game and replaces it with a single button and the fanciest logo you will ever see, it serves as a good first project to any portfolio.</p>
