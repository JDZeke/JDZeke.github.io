        <p>After the release of my first app, I decided it was time to make something better.<br><br>Don’t Lose is definitely less feature packed than Breakthrough, but it is more polished and I made it a quarter of the time. The gameplay is inspired by other “bullet hell” games where there is an overwhelming number of projectiles to dodge.<br><br>What makes Don’t Lose unique is how the player must collide with the numbers that appear on the screen before they reach 0. This added mechanic adds another layer of difficulty to the game.<br><br>Don’t Lose will likely be the last mobile game that I develop due to my declining interest in the field, but I am glad I was able to experience something different. Don't Lose has made it to the <a href="https://simmer.io/c/editors-choice">Editor's Choice</a> of SIMMER.io." See if you can beat my high score of 98.</p>
