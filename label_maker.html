        <p>In the summer of 2017, I was fortunate to get an internship at the Baltimore VA Medical Center where I was able to work on two different projects.<br><br>My first responsibility was to learn MATLAB so that I could aid in making programs for a research team. The team was developing a robotic leg exoskeleton to help stroke survivors walk without assistance. I did learn a fair amount of MATLAB but due to time restrictions, I was unable to contribute much to the actual development of the leg.<br><br>On the other hand, I was able to create a MS Access program that could print custom phlebotomy labels for the research lab and the nurses. The Label maker program was made with customizability and ease of use as the top two priorities, and it allows for different methods of printing depending on the situation.</p>
